Linear Regression Algorithm in Python 


Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors 


Three major uses for regression analysis are (1) determining the strength of predictors, (2) forecasting an effect, and (3) trend forecasting.


First, the regression might be used to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variable(s) have on a dependent variable.  Typical questions are what is the strength of relationship between dose and effect, sales and marketing spending, or age and income.



Second, it can be used to forecast effects or impact of changes.  That is, the regression analysis helps us to understand how much the dependent variable changes with a change in one or more independent variables.  A typical question is, “how much additional sales income do I get for each additional $1000 spent on marketing?”



Third, regression analysis predicts trends and future values.  The regression analysis can be used to get point estimates.  A typical question is, “what will the price of gold be in 6 months?”
